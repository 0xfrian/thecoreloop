‼️ SPECIAL INSIGHTS 👀
powered by AppMagic.rocks 😎

Today I decided to look at the my favorite game genres on the app store, which are RPG, Casinos, Shooters, and Card Games. 

RPG and Casinos each has about 5.8k games in their genres.  Shooters has about a third of that at 2.2k, while Card Games only had about 1.1k.  Although, the gross revenue for each genre seems to be in-line with one another (ie RPG has 3x the revenue of shooters), the Revenue per downloads (RpD)  is all over the place.  

RPGs has a RpD of $12.72, while Shooters had a mere $1.15 — even Card Games had a better RpD at $2.36.  Despite having the same game count as RPGs, Casino games had an RpD of $6.81.  However, when you break it up into East vs. West, a completely different pattern emerges.  

In the West, we have Casino games pulling in $15.8 RpD and RPGs only at $10.35.  But in the East, RPGs pull down a whopping $28.01 versus $11.61 for Casino.
