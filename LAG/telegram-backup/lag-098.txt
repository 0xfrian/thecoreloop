Look at Gaming #98 | Wednesday November 16th 2022 

‼️ SPECIAL INSIGHTS 👀
powered by AppMagic.rocks 😎

Today, let's take a look at the top 5 Chinese publishers: Tencent, NetEase, miHoYo Games, Lingxi Games, and FunPlus.  In 2022 YTD, these publishers earned $8.64B with 422M downloads.  For context, recall that Finnish publishers did $1.3B with 500M downloads and S. Korean publishers did $3.06B with 122M downloads.  Clearly, Chinese publishers' size is size. 

My Dashboard:
No link today.  I had to piece together 3-4 dashboards so will see if I can group those links in one.
