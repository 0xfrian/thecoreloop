We all know anime-themed mobile games have taken the world by storm.  But some parts of the world are more receptive to Anime art style than others.  Today, I'm doing a comparison between the top 5 Anime style art games for the East vs. West. 

YTD 2022
East: $2.36B rev ÷ 24M download = $98  RpD
vs.
West: $575M rev ÷ 15.15M download = $38 RpD 

The East has magnitudes more powerful monetization mechanics and/or high spending behaviors.  The West clearly isn't keeping up with their eastern counterparts.  Though the top game in both regions (Fate/Grand Order) is the same, the RpD is $419 vs. $118.
