‼️ SPECIAL INSIGHTS 👀

Did you know that Nintendo's mobile publishing business has $1.4B in lifetime rev with 676M downloads.  Surprisingly, this is a low number (not counting Pokemon GO!).  

That's why Nintendo is partnering up with DeNA, a large mobile publisher with $$2.4B in lifetime rev but only 127M downloads.  Clearly, DeNA monetizes their users nearly 9x better than Nintendo does.
