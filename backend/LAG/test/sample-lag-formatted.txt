‼️ SPECIAL INSIGHTS 👀
powered by AppMagic.rocks 😎

Hey everyone!  Since the year is almost over, I wanted to do an analysis of the most downloaded game in 2022, then compare that with the top 5 in the prior years.  Garena & Subway Surfers are in the top 5 all the way back until 2018.  If we expanded the the list to top 10, we see a few more new titles penetrating into the "forever-franchise" tier but getting to the top versus staying at the top are two very different things.  In 2015, Clash of Clans was 2nd on the list, then 8th, then 8th again then 26th, then not even the top 100 by 2019.  Keep in mind that Clash of Clans still received 3.5M downloads per month on avg in 2022.

Top 5 2022
1. Subway Surfers | 267M
2. Garena | 248M
3. Stumble Guys | 211M
4. Roblox | 173M
5. Candy Crush Saga | 157M

-----------------------

Top 5 2021
1. Garena | 249M
2. Subway Surfers | 187M
3. Bridge race | 175M
4. Roblox | 174M
5. Ludo King 160M
